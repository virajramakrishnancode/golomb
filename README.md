Creates and graphs golomb sequences

Golomb sequences:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golomb_sequence

A golomb sequence is "a non-decreasing integer sequence where an is the number of times that n occurs in the sequence, starting with a1 = 1, and with the property that for n > 1 each an is the smallest unique integer which makes it possible to satisfy the condition."

I generalized this to any starting numbers (although some starting numbers are not possible, in which case the code points this out)

I also graphed out these sequences with matplotlib
